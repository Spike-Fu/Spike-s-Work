I'm Spike(Meiwen) Fu. I give myself a rather "masculine" English name because I love to expolore the bundaries between genders. I am currently pursuing a Computer Science Games Bachelor degree at Univerisity of Southern California with a minor degree in East Asian Languages and Cultures. 

I have an extensive list of interests, and art is definitely on the top. Generally speaking, I enjoy presenting the world inside of my head to others. 

Here you can find some of my favorative past works. They might not be sophisicated or impressive, but they tell my personality: flexible, passionate, kind, communicative, and somewhat shy.
